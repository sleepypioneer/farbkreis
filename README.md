# Grow It - produce growing website for everyone

This project is an app to encourage people to grow produce themselves in the space they have, from herbs to pumpkins.

Containing a plant wiki and suggestions on how to get started the app taylors suggestions to your location, compass direction & light situation,
space available, and desired outcome (ie salad garden, herb garden, edible flowers, vegetables).
Additional sections to be added would include tips for composting, soils, insects as well as your own grow journal and a community section.
